# VillagerUnknown's Coin Stacks for Villager Coin

_This is an addon mod for Villager Coin._

Adds various Coin Stacks to Villager Coin that allow mapmakers and custom structures to provide stacks of coins for players to collect.

Coin Stacks cannot be crafted and come in multiple sizes: Small, Medium, and Large. Each size offers a multiplied value for players to collect. 
Small Coin Stacks provide the lowest value of that type while the Large provides the largest reasonable value. 
_(e.g. A Small Copper Coin Stack provides 1 Copper Coin, whereas a Medium Copper Coin Stack provides 50 Copper Coins 
and a Large Copper Coin Stack provides 100 Copper Coins.)_

Players can drop the value of a Coin Stack in coins to collect them by walking over, breaking, or interacting with it. 
(Almost as if they're knocking over the stack of coins.)
