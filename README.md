# VillagerUnknown's Coin Stacks for Villager Coin

_This is an addon mod for Villager Coin._

Adds various Coin Stacks to Villager Coin that allow players to decorate and mapmakers to provide stacks of coins for players to collect in custom structures and worlds.

## Features

* Adds 5 Small, 5 Medium, 5 Large, 5 Slab, and 5 Full Block Coin Stacks for the core Villager Coin types: Copper, Iron, Gold, Emerald, and Netherite.

Coin Stacks come in multiple forms: Small, Medium, Large, Slab, Block. Each form offers a multiplied value for players to collect.
Small Coin Stacks provide the lowest value of that type while the Large provides the largest reasonable value.
_(e.g. A Small Copper Coin Stack provides 1 Copper Coin, whereas a Medium Copper Coin Stack provides 50 Copper Coins
and a Large Copper Coin Stack provides 100 Copper Coins as 1 Silver Coin.)_

Coin Stacks can be crafted by placing an item stack of Copper, Iron, Gold, Emerald, or Netherite Villager Coins in the center of 
a 3x3 crafting table and placing a piece of string on each side to surround the coin.

- Small Coin Stacks can be crafted by surrounding 1 coin with string.
- Medium Coin Stacks can be crafted by surrounding 50 coins with string.
- Large Coin Stacks can be crafted by surrounding 100 coins with string.
- Coin Stack Slabs can be crafted by surrounding 500 coins with string.
- Coin Stack Blocks can be crafted by surrounding 1000 coins with string.

Players can drop the value of a Coin Stack in coins to collect them by breaking it or optionally walking over it. 
_If configured to allow players to walk over the stacks to collect them, they will have no collision for players stand on._ 
The blocks can be picked up in item form if broken with Silk Touch.
